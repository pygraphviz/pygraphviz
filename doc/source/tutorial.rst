Tutorial
========

The API is very similar to that of NetworkX.  Much of the 
NetworkX tutorial at https://networkx.org/documentation/latest/tutorial.html
is applicable to PyGraphviz.
See http://pygraphviz.github.io/documentation/latest/reference/api_notes.html  for major differences.

Start-up
--------

Import PyGraphviz with

>>> import pygraphviz as pgv

Graphs
------

To make an empty pygraphviz graph use the AGraph class:

>>> G = pgv.AGraph()

You can use the strict and directed keywords to control what type of
graph you want.  The default is to create a strict graph 
(no parallel edges or self-loops).  To create a digraph with possible
parallel edges and self-loops use

>>> G = pgv.AGraph(strict=False, directed=True)

You may specify a dot format file to be read on initialization:

>>> G = pgv.AGraph("Petersen.dot")  # doctest: +SKIP

Other options for initializing a graph are using a string,

>>> G = pgv.AGraph("graph {1 - 2}")

using a dict of dicts,

>>> d = {"1": {"2": None}, "2": {"1": None, "3": None}, "3": {"2": None}}
>>> A = pgv.AGraph(d)

or using a SWIG pointer to the AGraph datastructure,

>>> h = A.handle
>>> C = pgv.AGraph(h)


Nodes, and edges
----------------

Nodes and edges can be added one at a time 

>>> G.add_node("a")  # adds node 'a'
>>> G.add_edge("b", "c")  # adds edge 'b'-'c' (and also nodes 'b', 'c')

or from lists or containers.

>>> nodelist = ["f", "g", "h"]
>>> G.add_nodes_from(nodelist)

If the node is not a string an attempt will be made to convert it
to a string

>>> G.add_node(1)  # adds node '1'


Attributes
----------

To set the default attributes for graphs, nodes, and edges use
the graph_attr, node_attr, and edge_attr dictionaries

>>> G.graph_attr["label"] = "Name of graph"
>>> G.node_attr["shape"] = "circle"
>>> G.edge_attr["color"] = "red"

Graph attributes can be set when initializing the graph

>>> G = pgv.AGraph(ranksep="0.1")

Attributes can be added when adding nodes or edges,

>>> G.add_node(1, color="red")
>>> G.add_edge("b", "c", color="blue")

or through the node or edge attr dictionaries, 

>>> n = G.get_node(1)
>>> n.attr["shape"] = "box"


>>> e = G.get_edge("b", "c")
>>> e.attr["color"] = "green"

Layout and Drawing
------------------
Pygraphviz provides several methods for layout and drawing of graphs.

To store and print the graph in dot format as a Python string use

>>> s = G.string()

To write to a file use

>>> G.write("file.dot")

To add positions to the nodes with a Graphviz layout algorithm

>>> G.layout()  # default to neato
>>> G.layout(prog="dot")  # use dot

To render the graph to an image 

>>> G.draw("file.png")  # write previously positioned graph to PNG file
>>> G.draw("file.ps", prog="circo")  # use circo to position, write PS file
