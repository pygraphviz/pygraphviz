Installing
**********

Quick Install
=============

Get PyGraphviz from the Python Package Index at
http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pygraphviz

or install it with::

   pip install pygraphviz

and an attempt will be made to find and install an appropriate version
that matches your operating system and Python version.

You can install the development version (at github.com) with::

  pip install git://github.com/pygraphviz/pygraphviz.git#egg=pygraphviz


Providing path to graphviz
--------------------------

We tried our best to discover graphviz location automatically, but if you 
would like specify specific location for graphviz you may provide additrional parameters to specify graphviz location


include-path= path to graphviz include files
library-path= path to graphviz library files

For example

::

    python setup.py install --include-path=/usr/local/Cellar/graphviz/2.38.0/include/graphviz --library-path=/usr/local/Cellar/graphviz/2.38.0/lib

Installing from Source
======================

You can install from source by downloading a source archive file
(tar.gz or zip) or by checking out the source files from the
Subversion repository.

Source Archive File
-------------------

  1. Download the source (tar.gz or zip file).

  2. Unpack and change directory to pygraphviz-"version" 

  3. Run "python setup.py install" to build and install 

  4. (optional) Run "pytest" to execute the tests


Github
------

  1. Clone the pygraphviz repository

       git clone https://github.com/pygraphviz/pygraphviz.git

  (see https://github.com/pygraphviz/pygraphviz/ for other options)

  2. Change directory to "pygraphviz"

  3.  Run "python setup.py install" to build and install

  4. (optional) Run "pytest" to execute the tests


If you don't have permission to install software on your
system, you can install into another directory using
the --user, --prefix, or --home flags to setup.py.

For example

::

    python setup.py install --prefix=/home/username/python
    or
    python setup.py install --home=~
    or
    python setup.py install --user

If you didn't install in the standard Python site-packages directory
you will need to set your PYTHONPATH variable to the alternate location.
Seehttp://docs.python.org/2/install/index.html#search-path for further details.


Requirements
============

Python
------

PyGraphviz is tested and works with Python 3.7, 3.8. 3.9.

There are several other distributions that contain the key packages you need for scientific computing.  See the following link for a list: http://scipy.org/install.html

For Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7, the requirements are::
   
   sudo yum groups install -y "Development Tools"
   sudo yum install -y python-devel graphviz-devel
   sudo python -m pip install pytest


GraphViz
--------

To use PyGraphviz you need GraphViz version 2.16 or later.
Some versions have known bugs that have been fixed; get the latest
release available for best results.
